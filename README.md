# Dating Trust & Safety Rulebook

This repository contains working notes on trust & safety challenges specific to
relationship-driven platforms (e.g. dating, matchmaking, and intimacy-oriented services).

The focus is not content moderation alone, but the decisions that shape user behavior.

These notes are exploratory and meant to be part of a broader understanding rather than a prescribed one-size-fits-all solutions. 

## Scope

Topics covered include:
- Threat modeling for relationship platforms
- Reporting and response workflows
- Ban evasion
- Repeat-offender dynamics
- Identity-verification 

## What’s inside

- `threat-model.md`  
  Core actors, risks, and harm vectors specific to dating platforms

- `reportingresponse.md`  
  How reporting systems succeed or fail in practice

- `ban-evasion.md`  
  Patterns of repeat abuse and enforcement circumvention

- `verification-tradeoffs.md`  
  Privacy, safety, and accessibility tensions in identity systems

## Open questions

- What safety signals are most predictive *without* being overly invasive?
- Where should human judgment remain central despite automation pressure?
