# Identity & Verification Tradeoffs

Verification systems sit at the intersection of safety, privacy, and accessibility.
No single approach resolves all risks.

## Common verification approaches

- Email or phone number verification
- Government ID verification
- Photo or video confirmation
- Progressive or tiered verification models

## Benefits

- Increases friction for bad actors
- Can reduce impersonation and fraud
- May increase perceived safety for some users

## Costs and risks

- Excludes users without stable documentation
- Creates privacy and data retention concerns
- Can provide a false sense of safety
- Verification data itself becomes a high-value target

## Design tensions

- Anonymity vs accountability
- Safety vs accessibility
- Permanence vs reversibility
- Trust signals vs surveillance

## Promising directions

- Progressive verification tied to platform privileges
- Selective disclosure rather than full identity exposure
- Verification as *one signal among many*, not a gatekeeper

## Open question

How can platforms discourage harm without turning identity verification
into a prerequisite for participation or intimacy?
