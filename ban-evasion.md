# Ban Evasion and Repeat Offenders

Enforcement effectiveness depends less on issuing bans and more on preventing
predictable forms of evasion.

## Common evasion patterns

- Rapid re-registration with new emails or phone numbers
- Device reuse with minor configuration changes
- Rotating photos or slightly altered profile details
- Cycling between platforms within the same ecosystem

## Why bans alone are insufficient

- Low cost of account creation
- Delayed detection creates enforcement lag
- Over-aggressive blocking risks false positives
- Determined users adapt faster than static rules

## Mitigation strategies (conceptual)

- Progressive friction rather than immediate hard bans
- Rate limiting for new or recently reinstated accounts
- Cross-signal analysis (behavioral, temporal, network-based)
- Focus on *patterns* rather than single incidents

## Risks to manage

- Privacy overreach
- Disproportionate impact on marginalized users
- False positives that permanently lock out legitimate users
