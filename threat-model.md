# Threat Model: Relationship Platforms

This document outlines common threat actors and harm vectors on
dating platforms.

The goal is to understand *who can cause harm, how, and under what conditions*.

## Core assets to protect

- User physical and emotional safety
- Trust in the platform’s enforcement processes
- Privacy and identity integrity
- Legitimate user access (avoid collateral damage)

## Primary threat actors

- Harassers and coercive users
- Fraudsters (romance scams, financial exploitation)
- Repeat offenders using multiple accounts
- Users seeking to evade enforcement
- Coordinated abuse networks (less common, high impact)

## Common harm vectors

- Harassment and unwanted sexual content
- Emotional manipulation and coercion
- Impersonation and catfishing
- Financial fraud
- Doxxing or off-platform harassment escalation

## Platform-specific risk factors

- Asymmetric attention (some users receive vastly more exposure)
- High emotional vulnerability during early interaction
- Rapid account creation and low-cost identity resets
- Private messaging that moves off-platform quickly
