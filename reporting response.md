# Reporting and Response Systems

Reporting systems are often the primary interface between users and trust & safety.
Their design strongly influences whether users feel protected or dismissed.

## Common reporting failure modes

- Reports feel like a “black hole” (no feedback, no closure)
- Overly complex or emotionally burdensome reporting flows
- Delayed responses that arrive after harm has already escalated
- Generic enforcement outcomes that feel disconnected from context

## Structural challenges

- High report volume with limited human review capacity
- Ambiguous interpersonal situations that resist binary judgment
- Risk of retaliatory or bad-faith reporting
- Pressure to automate without sufficient nuance

## Characteristics of effective systems

- Clear expectations about what happens after a report
- Proportional response options (warnings, friction, limits, bans)
- Human-in-the-loop review for high-impact decisions
- Feedback that signals the report was taken seriously, even when action is limited

## Response tradeoffs

- Speed vs accuracy
- Transparency vs gaming risk
- Consistency vs contextual judgment

## Open questions

- When does “no action taken” still require user acknowledgment?
- How can platforms support emotional closure without over-sharing enforcement logic?
